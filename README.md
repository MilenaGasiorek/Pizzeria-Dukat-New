# Pizzeria-Dukat
This is the latest version of the commercial website created by me 2 years ago, it's been used by local pizzeria restaurant and I am the administrator of its content.
The website is mostly coded in HTML & CSS with the navigation being written with JavaScript. It has a couple of sections:

- landing page with hyperlink to 'about us' section
- about us
- menu
- notifications
- gallery
- contact
- how I get there

It is registered under domain https://pizzeria-dukat.pl/ and it's available only in polish language. 

The website was created according to Responsive Web Design (RWD) style - it looks good on mobile phones like Iphone 6S ( up to newest version) and android smartphones, as well as tablets.


Has been also tested on all popular browsers: Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge and Safari.
